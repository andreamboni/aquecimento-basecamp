/*
Level of difficulty
Easy

Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

Fixing errors in a program
Doing simple math with operators, variables and numbers
Order of operations
Use of parentheses to change the order of operations
Printing on screen
Scenario
Check the program in the editor. Find all possible compilation errors and logic errors. Fix them, but do not change any numeric values.

However, you may use parentheses (you can add or remove them). Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output. Before you use your the, try to find the errors only by manual code analysis.

Expected output
the result is: 28
the big result is: 59
