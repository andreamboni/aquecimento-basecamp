// Level of difficulty
// Easy

// Objectives
// Familiarize the student with:

// Conditions and conditional executions
// Fixing errors in program
// Printing on screen
// Scenario
// Check the program in the editor. Find all possible compilation errors and logic errors. Fix them and try to find proper conditions for all of the three statements.

// Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output. Before you use the compiler, try to find the errors only by manual code analysis.

// Expected output
// First condition is true
// Third condition is true

#include <stdio.h>
