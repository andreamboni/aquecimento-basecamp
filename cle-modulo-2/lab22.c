// Level of difficulty
// Easy

// Objectives
// Familiarize the student with:

// Printing data in different formats
// Fixing errors in a program
// Scenario
// You have the data (included in code) of three students' grades (StudentA, StudentB, StudentC). Write a program to print this data in rows - the first row is a header in the format:

// Student name  1stYGrade  2ndYGrade  3rdYGrade  Avg

// The next three rows contain: student name (StudentA, StudentB, StudentC is enough), grade (1stYGrade 2ndYGrade 3rdYGrade), and the average of these three grades (Avg). Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output.

// To print only two digits of a floating-point number, use the "%.2f" format specifier, and to fill it with spaces you can use the "%9.2f" format specifier where 9 is the length of the number and spaces.

// Expected output

// Student name  1stYGrade  2ndYGrade  3rdYGrade  Avg
// StudentA      4.20       4.50       4.20       4.30
// StudentB      4.30       4.40       4.70       4.47
// StudentC      4.30       4.80       4.90       4.67
