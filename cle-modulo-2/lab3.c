/*
Level of difficulty
Easy

Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

Fixing errors in a program
Floating-point numbers
Printing on screen
Scenario
Check the program in the editor. Find all possible compilation errors and logic errors. Fix them.

Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output. Before you use the compiler, try to find the errors only by manual code analysis. Later, you can use the constant value of Pi.

Expected output
The value of half is: 0.500000
The value of Pi is: 3.141593

int main()

	float halfValue = 0.6;
	float piValue = 3.141 592 65;
	printf("The value of half is: %f/2\n", half Value);
	printf("The value of Pi is: %f\n", pi_Value);
	return 0;
