/*
Level of difficulty
Easy

Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

Fixing errors in a program
Doing simple math with operators, variables and numbers
Printing on screen
Scenario
Check the program in the editor. Find all possible compilation errors and logic errors. Fix them, but do not change any numeric values.

Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output. Before you use the compiler, try to find the errors only by manual code analysis.

Expected output
The value of four is: 4
The value of five is: 5

	int fiveValue = 2 + 3;
	printf("The value of four is: %d\n", fourValue);
	printf("The value of five is: %d\n", fiveValue);
	return 0;
