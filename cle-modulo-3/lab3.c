// Objectives
// Familiarize the student with:

// Type conversions
// Conditional statements
// Integer numbers
// Floating-point numbers
// Getting input from the user
// Printing on screen
// Scenario
// Write a program that takes one floating-point number, converts it to an integer number, and then prints a description of the given number. Descriptions for numbers:

// numbers greater than or equal to 1 and less than 2 - Very bad.
// numbers greater than or equal to 2 and less than 3 - Bad.
// numbers greater than or equal to 3 and less than 4 - Neutral.
// numbers greater than or equal to 4 and less than 5 - Good.
// numbers greater than or equal to 5 and less than 6 - Very good.
// When a number is out of the given range (1<=x<6), the program should print nothing.

// Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output.

// Sample Input
// 1.5

// Expected output
// Very bad

// Sample Input
// 2.9

// Expected output
// Bad

// Sample Input
// 4.77

// Expected output
// Good
