// Level of difficulty
// Easy

// Objectives
// Familiarize the student with:

// Fixing errors in a program
// Integer numbers
// Printing on screen
// Scenario
// Write a program that computes and prints whether or not a given year is a leap year.

// A leap year is a year that is exactly (without a remainder) divisible by four, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400.

// Use the modulo operator and some logic operators in your program and try to write only one condition (of course you can now use the else keyword).

// Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output.

// Sample input
// 2010

// Expected output
// 2010 is not a leap year.

// Sample input
// 2015

// Expected output
// 2015 is not a leap year.

// Sample input
// 2000

// Expected output
// 2000 is a leap year.

// Sample input
// 1900

// Expected output
// 1900 is not a leap year.
